 *
 * react-grid-layout did this automatically on every render. Snapgrid renders the layout exactly as given,
 * so we have to do it ourselves whenever the stored layout may contain overlaps, for example:
 * - a repeated panel is expanded into one item per variable value, all sharing the original `x`/`y`;
 * - a duplicated panel is inserted right below its reference, on top of whatever was there;
 * - a panel dropped from another group lands on cells already occupied in the receiving group.
 *
 * Positions are computed in the persisted 24 column grid, and only `x`/`y` are rewritten so that
 * extra fields such as `repeatVariable` are kept on the returned items.
